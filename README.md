# RomanConverter-PokerGame
Two exercises of the KeepCoding bootcamp's JavaScript part.

## RomanConverter: 
-> First of all: use the command 'cd ./RomanConverter'.
To convert new roman numbers, just modify the file called 'to-convert', put new values always separated in new lines. 
Then use the command 'node .\roman-numbers-async.js' to use the async method or 'node .\roman-numbers-sync.js' to use the sync method.
Once done, you will see the results on the 'roman-numbers-results' file, on the top you can see which method you used.
