# RomanConverter-PokerGame
Two exercises of the KeepCoding bootcamp's JavaScript part.

## RomanConverter: 
-> First of all: 
  Use the following command to navigate to the RomanConverter folder:
  ```sh
    cd ./RomanConverter.
  ```
  Then, to convert new roman numbers, just modify the file called 'to-convert', put new values always separated in new lines. For example:
  ```sh
    ''
    999
    50
    9999
    XC
    MLX
    {}
    ['']
    .
  ```
  Finally, use the command:
  ```sh
    node .\roman-numbers-async.js
  ```
  For the async method or 
  ```sh
    node .\roman-numbers-sync.js'
  ```
  For the sync method.
  
  Once done, you will see the results on the 'roman-numbers-results' file, on the top you will see which method you've used.
